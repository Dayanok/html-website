        Choosing <strong>basketball</strong> as a hobby is a good idea because 
        it is one of the common everyday sports. People can play it anywhere like in the 
        gym, school, park, and house. What you need to prepare is only your 
        energy and the ball. This is the most strenuous cardiovascular 
        activities and it helps you to burn your calories more.
